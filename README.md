## üîé Overview

This repository contains a powerful integration of Roo Code's AI coding capabilities with Perplexity's research tools and GitHub's repository management features through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). By combining these systems, developers can leverage AI assistants that not only write code but also research best practices, manage repositories, and follow evidence-based development workflows.

The repo provides:

1. **Enhanced `.roomodes` configuration** - Optimized custom modes for AI coding assistants
2. **Syntaxed coding principles** - Token-efficient coding guidelines (7800‚Üí1100 tokens)
3. **Complete integration framework** - Structured workflows combining research and implementation

## üåü Why This Matters

Traditional AI coding assistants operate with limited context and struggle to maintain best practices consistently. This integration solves these problems by:

- **Real-time research integration** through Perplexity tools
- **Direct repository management** via GitHub MCP tools
- **Evidence-based development practices** with token-efficient guidelines
- **Specialized AI roles** for different development phases

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Components

### 1. Enhanced RooModes

The `.roomodes` file defines specialized AI personas, each optimized for specific development tasks:

- **SPARC Orchestrator** - Coordinates complex workflows with Perplexity research and GitHub integration
- **Research Specialist** - Leverages Perplexity and GitHub code search for information gathering
- **Git Manager** - Handles repository, branching and workflow strategies
- **Code Reviewer** - Performs evidence-based code reviews using research and best practices
- **And many more specialized roles**

### 2. Syntaxed Coding Principles

Token-efficient coding guidelines using symbolic notation:

```
*Evidence-Based Simplicity*
‚Üπ standards‚Ä¢solutions
‚äï clear‚Ä¢maintainable => validate
‚äï search => validate‚Ä¢simple
‚äï search_code => find‚Ä¢examples
‚äï evidence => minimize‚Ä¢complex
```

This compact representation captures sophisticated development principles while minimizing token usage.

### 3. Integrated MCP Tools

The system leverages two critical MCP tool integrations:

#### Perplexity Tools:
- `chat_perplexity` - Contextual conversation with research capacity
- `search` - General information retrieval across the web
- `get_documentation` - Documentation retrieval for specific technologies
- `find_apis` - API discovery and integration options
- `check_deprecated_code` - Code modernization validation

#### GitHub Tools:
- Repository Management (`create_repository`, `fork_repository`)
- File Operations (`create_or_update_file`, `push_files`, `get_file_contents`)
- Branch Management (`create_branch`, `list_commits`)
- Issue Tracking (`create_issue`, `update_issue`, `add_issue_comment`)
- Pull Request Workflow (`create_pull_request`, `get_pull_request_files`)
- Code Search (`search_code`, `search_repositories`)

## üöÄ Benefits for Developers

### 1. Research-Driven Development

Never code based on outdated practices again. The integration queries Perplexity in real-time to:

- Validate implementation approaches against current standards
- Check for deprecated code patterns before implementation
- Find reference examples from across the web
- Stay current with evolving language features and frameworks

### 2. Streamlined GitHub Workflows

Manage your entire development process without leaving your AI workflow:

- Create repositories, branches, and files directly
- Manage issues and pull requests programmatically
- Search across GitHub's vast ecosystem for code examples
- Implement version control best practices automatically

### 3. Evidence-Based Code Quality

Every code decision is backed by research and validation:

- Standards-verified implementations
- Current best practices in security and performance
- Validated architecture patterns
- Evidence-based refactoring approaches

### 4. Comprehensive Development Support

The system supports the full development lifecycle:

- Architecture and planning with research validation
- Implementation with current best practices
- Testing with appropriate methodologies
- Documentation with clear, accurate information
- Maintenance with deprecation tracking

## üìã Usage Examples

### Example 1: Starting a New Project

```
User: I need to create a modern React application with TypeScript that will manage inventory for a small business.

SPARC Orchestrator: Let me help you set up this project. I'll orchestrate this by:
1. Using Research Specialist to find current React+TypeScript best practices
2. Setting up a GitHub repository with proper structure
3. Creating appropriate branching strategy
4. Developing a specification with pseudocode
5. Implementing core features with TDD approach

Let me start by researching the latest approaches...
[Research with Perplexity]

Now, let's set up your repository structure...
[GitHub repository creation]

I'll now prepare an implementation plan with modern patterns...
```

### Example 2: Code Review and Improvement

```
User: Review this authentication implementation and suggest improvements.

Code Reviewer: I'll examine your authentication code, research current best practices, and provide evidence-based recommendations.

First, let me search for the latest authentication patterns for your stack...
[Research with Perplexity]

Now, comparing with your implementation, I've found several opportunities:
1. Your password hashing uses an outdated algorithm (verified via current OWASP guidelines)
2. The session management pattern could be improved (based on examples found in similar repositories)
3. The token refresh logic has a potential vulnerability (identified through security research)

Here are specific improvements with code examples...
```

### Example 3: Refactoring Legacy Code

```
User: Help me modernize this legacy Node.js API service.

Refinement-Optimization Mode: I'll help refactor your Node.js API. Let me research current best practices and detect deprecated patterns.

First, checking for deprecated code patterns in your codebase...
[Code analysis with Perplexity]

Based on my research of modern Node.js patterns, I recommend:
1. Converting callbacks to async/await (evidence from Node.js documentation)
2. Implementing proper error handling middleware (based on Express best practices)
3. Updating your database operations to use connection pooling (performance research findings)

Let me create a branch for these changes and submit a pull request with the modernized code...
[GitHub branch and PR creation]
```
