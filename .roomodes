Walk through its sections (Big Picture, Users, Features, Information, Look & Feel, Platform, Rules, Success Criteria, Inspirations).\n    *   Explain how clear answers in the Blueprint directly fuel the AI's ability to research, specify, architect, and test correctly.\n    *   Example: "A good 'Success Criteria' scenario in your Blueprint becomes a direct E2E test case in the Test Plan."\n3.  **User's Role & Input - Change Requests/Bug Reports (for Existing Projects):**\n    *   Explain how to write clear, concise, and actionable bug reports (steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual) or enhancement requests for `Orchestrator_Refinement_And_Maintenance`.\n4.  **The "Test-First" Paradigm with AI:**\n    *   Clearly explain WHY tests are written *before* the AI codes the feature logic: The tests become the *specification* for the AI Coder. The AI's task is simplified to "make these tests pass."\n    *   Contrast this with trying to test AI-generated code afterwards, which can be like "testing a black box."\n    *   Explain how `Tester_TDD_Master` implements tests against *intended* (but not yet existing) functions based on specs/arch.\n5.  **Context Management for AI Specialists:** Explain that orchestrators carefully manage what information each specialist AI (Coder, Tester, Architect) sees to keep them focused and efficient, respecting LLM context limits. User inputs (Blueprint, change requests) are broken down.\n6.  **Pheromone Signals (High-Level Concept):** Briefly mention that the system uses internal signals (like 'bug_detected' or 'feature_ready_for_coding') to help orchestrators prioritize work, making it adaptive. Users don't need to interact with these directly.\n7.  **Interacting with the System:** Explain `new_task` and `attempt_completion` are how users see work delegated. Focus on providing clear initial inputs and then reviewing outputs/reports from major orchestrator phases.\n8.  **Iterative Nature & AI's Role in Debugging:** AI coders might take multiple attempts to pass tests. `Debugger_Targeted` assists in this iterative process. This is normal for AI-driven development.",

      "customInstructions": "Objective: Provide a comprehensive, step-by-step tutorial for users new to this AI development system.\n\nTutorial Structure (Illustrative Markdown outline to generate):\n\n```markdown\n# Welcome to the AI-Powered Phased, Test-First Development Workflow!\n\nThis tutorial guides you through how our system, using specialized AI assistants, builds software from your ideas.\n\n## 1. The Big Idea: Phased Orchestration & Test-First for AI\n\n*   **Why this way?** Traditional coding vs. AI coding needs. LLMs need clear specs. Tests *are* the clearest spec for an AI Coder.\n*   **Our Orchestrators:** Think of them as project managers for different stages.\n    *   `Orchestrator_Project_Initialization`: Gets your idea, researches it.\n    *   `Orchestrator_Framework_Scaffolding`: Builds the empty house frame.\n    *   `Orchestrator_Test_Specification_And_Generation`: Designs all the quality checks (tests) *before* building the rooms.\n    *   `Orchestrator_Feature_Implementation_TDD`: Tells AI builders (Coders) to build rooms that pass those specific checks.\n    *   `Orchestrator_Integration_And_System_Testing`: Puts it all together and does final checks.\n    *   `Orchestrator_Refinement_And_Maintenance`: For changes later on.\n\n## 2. Your Starting Point: The User Blueprint (For New Projects)\n\n*   **This is YOUR critical input!** The more detail, the better the AI builds.\n*   **Key Blueprint Sections & Why They Matter to AI:**\n    *   **Big Picture (Elevator Pitch, Problem, Why):** Sets the `Goal` for `ResearchPlanner_Strategic`.\n    *   **Features (Core Actions, Deep Dive):** Helps `ResearchPlanner_Strategic` and `SpecWriter_Feature_Overview` define what to build.\n    *   **Success Criteria:** Directly informs test cases planned by `Spec_To_TestPlan_Converter`.\n    *   *(Explain a few more sections briefly)*\n*   **Example:** Imagine you want a 'Recipe App'.\n    *   Blueprint Feature: 'User can search for recipes by ingredient.'\n    *   Blueprint Success Criteria: 'When I search \"tomato\", I see recipes with tomatoes.'\n\n## 3. Phase 0: Project Initialization - From Blueprint to Plan\n\n*   **You submit your Blueprint.**\n*   `Orchestrator_Project_Initialization` takes over.\n*   It tasks `@ResearchPlanner_Strategic` to research your app idea, similar apps, best technologies. Planner produces reports.\n*   Then, it tasks `@SpecWriter_Feature_Overview` and `@Architect_HighLevel_Module` for each major feature idea from the Blueprint & Research.\n*   **Output:** A `Master_Project_Plan.md` with links to these initial docs.\n\n## 4. Phase 1 (Part A): Framework Scaffolding - The Empty Shell\n\n*   `Orchestrator_Framework_Scaffolding` gets the Master Plan.\n*   Tasks `@DevOps_Foundations_Setup` to create folders, install tools, basic CI (like GitHub Actions).\n*   Tasks `@Coder_Framework_Boilerplate` to write empty API routes or DB connection files.\n*   Tasks `@Tester_TDD_Master` (Action: `Setup Test Harness`) to set up Pytest/Jest.\n*   **Output:** A project you could (almost) run, but it does nothing yet.\n\n## 5. Phase 1 (Part B): Test Specification & Generation - DESIGNING THE TESTS FIRST!\n\n*   **For EACH Feature (e.g., 'Recipe Search'):**\n*   `Orchestrator_Test_Specification_And_Generation` is activated.\n*   Inputs: Feature Overview Spec (from Phase 0), Feature Module Arch (from Phase 0).\n*   Tasks `@Spec_To_TestPlan_Converter`. **Output:** `feature_RecipeSearch_test_plan.md` detailing:\n        *   Unit Test for `SearchService.find_by_ingredient()`: Given 'tomato', expect recipes A, B.\n        *   Unit Test for `SearchService.find_by_ingredient()`: Given 'xyz123' (non-existent), expect empty list.\n        *   Integration Test: (Mocked) `RecipeDisplayComponent` correctly shows results from `SearchService`.\n*   Then, it tasks `@Tester_TDD_Master` (Action: `Implement Tests from Plan Section`). **Output:** `test_recipe_search.py` containing Python/Jest code for the tests above. These tests will FAIL now because `SearchService.find_by_ingredient()` doesn't exist!\n\n## 6. Phase 2: Feature Implementation - AI Codes to Pass Tests!\n\n*   **For EACH Feature (e.g., 'Recipe Search'):**\n*   `Orchestrator_Feature_Implementation_TDD` is activated.\n*   Inputs: The `test_recipe_search.py` and the feature's spec/arch.\n*   **The Loop Begins:**\n    1.  Orchestrator identifies a failing test (e.g., `test_find_by_ingredient_with_tomato`).\n    2.  Tasks `@Coder_Test_Driven`: 'Write `SearchService.find_by_ingredient()` in `search_service.py` to make `test_find_by_ingredient_with_tomato` pass. Spec says it should query a DB (mocked for now).'\n    3.  Coder attempts to write `search_service.py`. Returns path to it.\n    4.  Orchestrator tasks `@Tester_TDD_Master` to run ALL tests in `test_recipe_search.py` against `search_service.py`.\n    5.  **If `test_find_by_ingredient_with_tomato` PASSES but `test_find_by_ingredient_with_xyz123` still FAILS:** Loop back to step 1, targeting the new failing test for the Coder.\n    6.  **If Coder gets stuck after 2-3 tries:** Orchestrator tasks `@Debugger_Targeted` to analyze why `test_X` is failing with Coder's current `search_service.py` and suggest a fix.\n    7.  This loop continues until ALL tests in `test_recipe_search.py` PASS.\n*   **Output:** A fully coded `search_service.py` that is proven correct *by the pre-written tests*.\n\n## 7. Phase 3: Integration & System Validation\n\n*   `Orchestrator_Integration_And_System_Testing` takes all Features that passed their tests.\n*   Tasks `@Integrator_Module` to merge their code (e.g., 'Recipe Search' feature, 'User Profile' feature) into the main project.\n*   Then tasks `@Tester_TDD_Master` to run BIG system-wide tests (e.g., a full user journey from searching to saving a recipe). Catches bugs where features interact badly.\n\n## 8. Phase 4: Maintenance & Enhancements (Using `Orchestrator_Refinement_And_Maintenance`)\n\n*   Similar Test-First approach: New bug? First write a test that SHOWS the bug, then task AI Coder to make that (and all other) tests pass.\n\n## 9. Your Ongoing Role\n\n*   Provide excellent Blueprints / Change Requests.\n*   Review Test Plans (do they cover your Success Criteria?).\n*   Review final integrated features against your vision.\n*   Report bugs clearly if found post-deployment.\n\nThis structured, test-first approach helps us build reliable software with AI assistants!\n```\n\nThis provides a very concrete, user-friendly walkthrough that aligns with the refined, self-contained mode definitions.",
