Task Completed
The initial strategy involved applying code modifications and logging additions to app/csv_ingestor/csv_ingestor.py as recommended:

Added detailed logging in _standardize_booleans to trace non-mappable boolean values.
Added logging in the OSError catch block within load_csv to capture errno for permission issues.
Commented out the overly aggressive .str.strip() call on line 321 for StringDtype columns within _infer_and_convert_data_types to rely on skipinitialspace=True in pd.read_csv for whitespace handling, as per diagnosis point 2.5.
Following these code changes, Perplexity was consulted to confirm the nature of np.True_ is True vs np.True_ == True comparisons, which reinforced the diagnosis.

Tests were executed using pytest. The output revealed numerous errors and failures, many of which appear unrelated to the CSV ingestion module (e.g., TypeError in NodeMapper affecting Neo4j and ontology tests).

Focusing on CSV-related failures, the following test file modifications were made based on the diagnosis report and Perplexity research:

In tests/functional/csv_ingestion/test_csv_missing_values.py, boolean comparison assertions like assert df.loc[0, 'col_bool_na'] is True were changed to assert df.loc[0, 'col_bool_na'] == True to correctly compare values rather than object identity.
In tests/functional/csv_ingestion/test_csv_data_types.py, for the parameterized test test_invalid_data_type_conversion_to_pd_na_and_logging, the expected_dtype for the "datetime_col" case was changed from object to pd.Timestamp("now").dtype (to represent datetime64[ns]), and the corresponding log message check was updated to search for "datetime conversion" more accurately. This change was applied across two apply_diff attempts due to an interruption in the first attempt for this specific file.
The session concluded due to reaching the operational token limit before further test analysis or remediation steps could be undertaken.

Work Performed This Session:

Reviewed diagnosis report (docs/diagnoses/CSV_Dataset_Ingestion_and_Parsing_Remediation_Diagnosis.md).
Modified app/csv_ingestor/csv_ingestor.py to add logging for boolean conversion and permission errors, and adjusted string whitespace handling.
Researched boolean comparison nuances.
Executed pytest (full output provided in the previous user message).
Modified tests/functional/csv_ingestion/test_csv_missing_values.py to correct boolean assertions.
Modified tests/functional/csv_ingestion/test_csv_data_types.py to correct expected_dtype for datetime_col and the associated log check in a parameterized test.
Key Files Modified:

app/csv_ingestor/csv_ingestor.py
tests/functional/csv_ingestion/test_csv_missing_values.py
tests/functional/csv_ingestion/test_csv_data_types.py
Current Test State:
The last full test output was provided in the user message preceding this completion attempt. Analysis of this output was interrupted by the token limit. Numerous failures are present, including those related to CSV ingestion which are the target of this task, and many others outside this immediate scope.

Identified Needs and Remaining Tasks for Restart:

Immediate Next Step: Analyze the full test output from the last pytest run (provided by the user prior to this message) to identify the exact CSV-related test failures after the latest code and test modifications.
Verify Last Change: Confirm the changes to tests/functional/csv_ingestion/test_csv_data_types.py (lines 191 and 257-262) were fully and correctly applied, as the apply_diff process for this file was interrupted and then re-attempted. If issues persist with test_invalid_data_type_conversion_to_pd_na_and_logging[datetime_col...], re-reading this file and verifying the changes would be prudent.
Address Remaining Assertion Issues (Diagnosis Report Section 3):
In tests/functional/csv_ingestion/test_csv_structure_and_parsing.py, update test_correct_row_count: change expected row count from 3 to 7 for td_valid_datatypes.csv.
In tests/functional/csv_ingestion/test_csv_structure_and_parsing.py, update test_header_row_utilization: ensure expected headers match those in td_valid_datatypes.csv.
Address Remaining Code-Related CSV Failures (based on diagnosis and new test output):
Further investigate and fix boolean conversion issues if test_data_type_conversions_and_pd_na or test_invalid_data_type_conversion_to_pd_na_and_logging[mixed_bool_col...] still fail.
Resolve why PermissionError is not being raised as expected in test_ingest_unreadable_csv (tests/functional/csv_ingestion/test_csv_file_handling.py). This may involve inspecting the exact error and errno in the test environment as suggested in the diagnosis.
Address the LF line ending issue in test_line_ending_robustness (tests/functional/csv_ingestion/test_csv_structure_and_parsing.py), potentially by inspecting td_lf.csv and testing minimal pd.read_csv calls.
Fix the test_malformed_csv_unescaped_quotes failure (tests/functional/csv_ingestion/test_csv_structure_and_parsing.py) where the DataFrame is not None. This might involve adjusting pd.read_csv parameters like quoting or further scrutinizing td_malformed_quotes.csv.
This is a partial completion due to the operational token limit being reached. The orchestrator must reassign the task. This Coder (Test-Driven - Natural Language Summary) mode can be re-tasked with this summary and the original input task details to continue the remediation. The Pheromone Scribe orchestrator should not be updated with task completion signals for "CSV Dataset Ingestion and Parsing - Remediation" until all coding tasks for this feature are fully complete and all relevant tests pass, or if explicitly instructed by a higher-level orchestrator.

This summary field details all outcomes from the TDD process for the target feature "CSV Dataset Ingestion and Parsing - Remediation" during this session, the current state of the codebase as modified, identified needs for continuation, any problem reports encountered (such as the token limit), and relevant data for handover. This natural language information is intended for use by higher-level orchestrators in the SPARC system. This summary does not contain any pre-formatted colon-separated signal text or structured signal proposals.
