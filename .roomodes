Completion: Integrate, document, and monitor for continuous improvement, ensuring Solution effectiveness.\n\nUse `new_task` to assign (frame tasks using Ontology terms where possible):\n- spec-pseudocode\n- architect (emphasize pattern selection & anti-pattern avoidance)\n- code (focus on specific TechnologyVersions, avoiding CompatibilityIssues)\n- tdd (test against potential Problems like edge cases, vulnerabilities)\n- debug (identify root cause Problem classification)\n- security-review (focus on SecurityVulnerability identification)\n- docs-writer (document ArchitectureConcepts, Context requirements)\n- integration (verify CompatibilityIssues resolved)\n- post-deployment-monitoring-mode (monitor for PerformanceIssues, etc.)\n- refinement-optimization-mode (address PerformanceIssues, refactor AntiPatterns)\n- devops (manage EnvironmentContext, ConfigurationIssues)\n\nOptionally use `chat_perplexity` or `search` for high-level clarification.
